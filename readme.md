#1. Introduction

	This project has been created for the course "Mobile App Development" at the FH Joanneum.
	It should be a useful app for animal owner, especially for people who live together with cats...
	Well, as cats are very headstrong they often decide spontaneous that they don't like a specific kind of food anymore. 
	For example this week beef is very tasteful but maybe next week beef is uneatable... 
	As an owner you often open a lot of cans which will stay untouched.
	CATLicious will help the human can opener of a cat to detect the currently most favourite food. 
	Therefore, this app represents a rating app: the operator of the app has to generate a profile for each animal and
	the bought kind of food. Afterwards the owner can rate the sort of food depending on the amount which was left by the cat.
	Moreover, a food locator to find the next shop will be implemented.
